# AGENTS.md — WC 2026 Sweepstake Tracker

## What This Is

A static SPA tracking the FIFA World Cup 2026 sweepstake for a group of colleagues. 48 teams are assigned to people (some people paid double and have two teams). The app shows group standings, a knockout bracket, and a match calendar — always associating teams with their sweepstake owner.

Deployed on GitHub Pages. No backend. May use browser localStorage for user preferences.

## Tournament Format

- 48 teams in 12 groups (A–L) of 4
- Group stage: top 2 per group + 8 best 3rd-place teams advance (32 teams total)
- Knockout: Round of 32 → Round of 16 → Quarter-finals → Semi-finals → Third-place → Final
- Dates: June 11 – July 19, 2026
- All matches in USA, Canada, and Mexico (late evening / night BST for UK viewers)

## Tech Stack

- **Vite** — build tool and dev server
- **React 18** + **TypeScript**
- **Tailwind CSS** — utility-first styling
- **GitHub Pages** — deployment target (static `dist/`)

## Tabs / Views

### Group Stage
- Points table for each group (Played, Won, Drawn, Lost, GF, GA, GD, Points)
- List of played and upcoming matches per group with scores
- Person selection: highlight that person's rows; toggle to filter to only their groups

### Knockout Stage
- **Bracket/tree chart** showing the full knockout draw from Round of 32 to Final
- Scores shown for completed matches; TBD placeholders for future rounds
- Must support **zoom and pan on mobile** (touch gestures) — this is non-negotiable since the bracket is too wide for a phone viewport
- Person selection: highlight that person's team(s) path through the bracket

### Calendar
- Chronological list of upcoming matches with: date, BST kick-off time, teams, venue/city, group/round
- Person selection: filter to only matches involving that person's team(s)

## Person Visibility Rule

Whenever a country team is displayed, also show the sweepstake person who owns that team — **unless** the person↔team association is already evident in the immediate context (e.g. in a "Sarah Y's matches" filtered view, don't redundantly label every row with "Sarah Y").

## User Selection

- Global selector (dropdown or similar) to pick a person — affects all tabs
- Default: "Everyone" (no filter/highlight)
- Persisted in localStorage so it survives page refresh
- Some people own two teams — selection highlights/filters both

## Data

All data is **statically imported** from `src/data/` (TypeScript modules). Updating results requires editing, rebuilding, and deploying.

Source JSON files live in `data/` at the project root (canonical reference data):
- `data/entrants.json` — team → person + group
- `data/groups.json` — group compositions
- `data/schedule.json` — all 104 matches (UTC kickoff times, venues, stages)
- `data/venues.json` — 16 venues with IANA timezone identifiers

App-consumable modules in `src/data/` re-export or transform these.

### Updating Results

A `results` data structure (initially empty) records completed match scores. Each entry: `{ matchId, homeScore, awayScore }`. To update: edit the results file, rebuild, push to deploy.

### Team Names

Team names use the canonical names from the football-data.org API. Key names that differ from common usage:
- "Bosnia-Herzegovina" (not "Bosnia and Herzegovina")
- "Cape Verde Islands" (not "Cabo Verde")
- "South Korea" (not "Korea Republic")
- "United States" (not "USA")
- "Ivory Coast" (not "Côte d'Ivoire")
- "Iran" (not "IR Iran")
- "Turkey" (not "Türkiye")

## Commands

```bash
npm install              # Install dependencies
npm run dev              # Dev server (localhost:5173)
npm run build            # Production build → dist/
npm run preview          # Preview production build locally
npm run deploy           # Deploy to GitHub Pages
```

## Styling

- Tailwind utility classes throughout. No custom CSS unless unavoidable.
- Mobile-first responsive design — people will check on phones during the workday.
- Use team flag emojis or small flag images where available.
- Knockout bracket: implement with a pannable/zoomable container (CSS transform + touch event handling, or a lightweight library).

## Times

- Stored internally as UTC ISO strings (e.g. `2026-06-11T19:00:00Z`)
- Displayed in BST (UTC+1) throughout the UI — this is a UK-based group
- Format: e.g. "Wed 11 Jun, 8:00 PM"

## Deployment

GitHub Actions workflow on push to `main` builds and deploys to GitHub Pages. The `base` in `vite.config.ts` must match the repo path (e.g., `/wc-2026/`).

## Testing

This app has no unit tests. Testing is done **manually by an agent** using Chrome DevTools (via the `chrome-devtools` MCP server) to inspect the running app, verify layout, check data rendering, and interact with UI elements.

### Fake Data for Pre-Tournament Testing

Before real results are available, the app must expose a global function on `window` to inject fake match results via the browser console. This allows an agent (or a human) to simulate tournament progress without editing source files or rebuilding.

```js
// Example browser console usage:
window.__injectResults([
  { matchId: 1, homeScore: 2, awayScore: 1 },
  { matchId: 2, homeScore: 0, awayScore: 0 },
]);

// Clear all injected results:
window.__clearResults();
```

- `window.__injectResults(results)` — merges the provided results into the app's reactive state, triggering re-renders of group tables, knockout bracket, and calendar.
- `window.__clearResults()` — resets to the real (committed) results data.
- These functions must be available in both dev and production builds.

## API — football-data.org

Match data (schedule and scores) is fetched client-side from the football-data.org v4 API. The API key is exposed in the client bundle — this is accepted (see `src/utils/api.ts`).

- **Client**: `src/utils/api.ts` — `fetchMatches()` with 60s fresh cache, stale-cache fallback on errors/429, and one retry after rate-limit reset
- **Hook**: `src/hooks/useMatches.ts` — returns `{ apiError, lastUpdated, loading, matches, scoresStale }`
- **Caching**: localStorage key `wc2026-matches`. Fresh TTL 60 seconds; expired entries used when the API is unreachable
- **Status UI**: `App.tsx` header shows last update time, stale-cache notice, or “schedule only” when the API fails with no cache
- **Data flow**: `App.tsx` calls `useMatches()` and passes `matches: Match[]` to all three views. Merge order: injected console results > API scores > static schedule. Scores live on `Match` objects (`homeScore`, `awayScore`)
